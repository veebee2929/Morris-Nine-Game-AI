# Morris-Nine-Game-AI
The morris game made with AI introductions


This Game was made for an AI course at UTD. 
We use two different techniques to learn more about them: 
AB pruning and MinMax Tree. 
A lot of experimentation has been done to try and make the game more efficient. 
All the different models are written in Python. 
The inputs and outputs folder contains various boards given as input and the responsing output to them and the different behaviour observed can be seen.
Furthermore, the project report shows detailed differences.
